        <h1>Bucket List: My Dream Travel Destinations</h1>
        <h2>Places and events I want to experience when I'm rich</h2>

    <p>I have always loved to travel. As a child, my parents took me to many beautiful
        cities. I loved to explore the cities and their culture. We went to
        museums, historical sites, events and, my favorite, local restaurants.  Exploring the local food culture was always exciting. My bucketlist 
        of destinations are rich in all of these things.
